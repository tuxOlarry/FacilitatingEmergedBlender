* Messages for package media-gfx/blender-2.93.9:

 *
 * Blender uses python integration. As such, may have some
 * inherent risks with running unknown python scripts.
 *
 * It is recommended to change your blender temp directory
 * from /tmp to /home/user/tmp or another tmp file under your
 * home directory. This can be done by starting blender, then
 * changing the 'Temporary Files' directory in Blender preferences.
 *
 *
 * This ebuild does not unbundle the massive amount of 3rd party
 * libraries which are shipped with blender. Note that
 * these have caused security issues in the past.
 * If you are concerned about security, file a bug upstream:
 *   https://developer.blender.org/
 *
 * You are building Blender with a newer python version than
 * supported by this version upstream.
 * If you experience breakages with e.g. plugins, please switch to
 * python_single_target_python3_9 instead.
